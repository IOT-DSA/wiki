## Warning

For the simple fact that you are reading this page, your intelligence and sanity are both being questioned. The content below contains a fair amount of sarcasm and resent towards Eclipse.

## Prerequisites

- Intelligence to some degree
- The personality of a masochist

## Installation Instructions
This page is for people who just don't seem to know how to use Google or prefer a mediocre development environment. Only awesome people use https://www.jetbrains.com/idea.

### Steps

- Navigate to http://bfy.tw/2e5w and click on the link that leads to the marketplace. I'm sorry if you can't find the link. Maybe you should try looking for yourself.
- Use the "Install" button as provided. If you don't know how to use a button in 2015, well, you have some problems to deal with.
- Make sure you clone the template repository from https://github.com/IOT-DSA/template-dslink-java. If you don't have git installed, click the "Download Zip" button in shame.
- Import the project into Eclipse: File > Import Project > Gradle Project > Path to the template
- Setup a run configuration:
  - Set the working directory to template/build
  - Set the program arguments to: -b http://localhost:8080/conn -d ../dslink.json
- Run it. Congratulations, you're running an editor slightly better than Microsoft Notepad!

If you couldn't make it through all the steps, please reread the prerequisites.
