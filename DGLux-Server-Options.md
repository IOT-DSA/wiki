The DGLux Server has many options that allow you to tweak how the server works and customize it for your own use.

Options are defined in the server.json

An example server.json is:

```json
{
  "debug": false,
  "port": 8080,
  "httpsport": 8443,
  "certName": "",
  "certPassword": "",
  "disableFileSecurity": false,
  "broadcast": false,
  "workers": 2,
  "updateInterval": 200,
  "static": {},
  "linkConfig": {},
  "disabledLinks": [],
  "uptimeCheckUrl": null,
  "upstream": {},
  "quarantine": false,
  "defaultPermission": null,
  "useRuntimeManager": false,
  "passwordHasherIterations": 1000,
  "passwordHasherKeyLength": 32,
  "brokerName": "broker-",
  "runBrokerInMain": false
}
```

## debug

**Default Value**: 8080

## httpsport

HTTPs Port to listen on. If this is less than or equal to 0, and/or `certName` or `certPassword` is empty or not provided, then the server does not listen on any port for HTTPS. Ensure that you setup your SSL certificate and fill in the certName and certPassword fields.

## workers

Number of Server Workers. For low end devices, this should stay at 1. For large machines, this can be set to the number of available processors to better handle massive amounts of connections.

**Default Value**: For low end devices, this is 1, for other devices, this is 2.
