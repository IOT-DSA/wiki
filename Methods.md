# Methods

Methods are used in a request to retrieve data. They specify what type of data is needed and will
return it. Permissions affect how data is interacted with by a user.

Request fields are sent in the top level JSON request. Response fields return in the update field,
methods will go into more detail on how updates are received. All responses are a map in the first
element of the update field unless otherwise specified by the method.
