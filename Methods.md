# Methods

Methods are used in a request to retrieve data. They specify what type of data is needed and will
return it. Permissions affect how data is interacted with by a user.

Request fields are sent in the top level JSON request. Response fields return in the update field,
methods will go into more detail on how updates are received. All responses are a map in the first
element of the update field unless otherwise specified by the method.

#### List of methods

- list
- set
- remove
- invoke
- subscribe
- unsubscribe
- close

## List

This method will retrieve a list of children, attributes, and configs. However, children without the read permission will
not be displayed.

The response of list will update on any node change available to the current requester, there is no need to list on same node twice in same requester because second stream will return same state as the previous list stream's final state.

#### Request fields

- path (string)
  - Path of the node to retrieve a list on

#### Response columns
 - name
  - Name of the field
  - Names that start with '$' are [configs](Configs) that can affect how system works
    - "$is"
      - profile of the node, must be the first update of a list stream, otherwise requester will treat it as a new node and clear other existing data
      - profile node should also be loaded to get all predefined configs/attributes of a node
      - profile nodes locate in /defs/profile/
    - "$mixin"
      - attributes and configs mixin of a node, multiple mixins are separated with "|"
      - when mixin path starts with "/", it's a absolute node path
      - when mixin path starts doesn't start with "/", it's a node path relative to the current node being listed
    - "$permission"
      - a enum of the following values
        - **read** user has read access to the node, can be omitted
        - **write** user has write access to the node, can read node and write to node and its attributes
        - **config** user has full access to the node, can read/write and change configs 
   - Names that start with '@' are custom attributes
   - Other names are children nodes, with map value of the children properties
        - children node must include **$name** if it has a display name
        - children node must include **$is** in the child object
        - children node must include **$mixin** if it's not empty
        - children node must include **$permission** if it's not 'read'
        - children node should include **$invokable** if user is allowed to invoke it 
        - children node should include **$type** if node support subscription
        - children node should include **$interface** if it's defined
        - **$invokable**, **$type**, **$interface** are not needed if it's already defined in $is profile.
        - other properties of children nodes shouldn't appear in the list response.
   - Names must not be blank or contain these characters: ```. / \ ? % * : | â€œ < >```

 columns list is defined in the action node.

     - sid - Subscription ID
     - cache (optional, default of 1) - The cache of values the responder contains. If the responder can't write a subscription update to the requester then it will use the cache of values.

#### Response columns

No response update to the direct response.
the value update will be sent in the main subscription stream, which has the following columns

There are multiple elements in the updates field. Each element will contain:
