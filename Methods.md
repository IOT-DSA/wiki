# Methods

Methods are used in a request to retrieve data. They specify what type of data is needed and will
return it. Permissions affect how data is interacted with by a user.

Request fields are sent in the top level JSON request. Response fields return in the updates field,
methods will go into more detail on how updates are received.

#### List of methods

- list
- set
- remove
- invoke
- subscribe
- unsubscribe
- close

## List

This method will retrieve a list of children, attributes, and configs. However, children without the read permission will
not be displayed.

The response of list will update on any node change available to the current requester, there is no need to list on same node twice in same requester because second stream will return same state as the previous list stream's final state.

#### Request fields

- path (string)
  - Path of the node to retrieve a list on

#### Response columns
 - name
  - Name of the field
  - Names that start with '$' are [configs](Configs) that can affect how system works
    - "$is"
      - profile of the node, must be the first update of a list stream, otherwise requester will treat it as a new node and clear other existing data
      - profile node should also be loaded to get all predefined configs/attributes of a node
      - profile nodes locate in /defs/profile/
    - "$permission"
      - a enum of the following values
        - **read** user has read access to the node, can be omitted
        - **write** user has write access to the node, can read node and write to node and its attributes
        - **config** user has full access to the node, can read/write and change configs 
   - Names that start with '@' are custom attributes
   - Other names are children nodes, with map value of the children properties
        - children node must include **$name** if it has a display name
        - children node must include **$is** in the child object
        - children node must include **$permission** if it's not 'read'
        - children node should include **$invokable** if user is allowed to invoke it 
        - children node should include **$type** if node support subscription
        - children node should include **$interface** if it's defined
          - **$interface** are not needed if it's already defined in $is profile.
        - other properties of children nodes shouldn't appear in the list response.
   - Names must not be blank or contain these characters: ```. / \ ? * : | â€œ < >```
   - When % is used in name, it must be used only for UTF-8 based percent encode, not for other purpose. 

 - value
  - updated value of the field

#### Response meta
 - change (optional enum configuration)
   - enum value, can be "remove" or "update"
   - default value is "update"

#### Example usage

##### Request
```json
{
  "rid": 1,
  "method": "list",
  "path": "/light"
}
```

##### Response
```json
{
  "rid": 1,
  "stream": "open",

  ]
}
```

## Set

This method will set values on a node.

#### Request fields
 - path (type:path)
   -  path of the node to set, can be a node path or attribute/config path
 - permit (string, optional)
   - max permission of this Set
     - if $writable require "config" permission to change value, and requester do have "config" permission, but permit is "read", the action should still return a "permissionDenied" error.
 - value (any primitive type)
  - The type of the value must be acceptable to the type of the node.

#### Response columns

No response update.

#### Example usage

The value in this usage turns the lights on (true) or off (false).

##### Request
```json
{
  "rid": 1,
  "method": "set",
  "permit": "write",
  "path": "/lights/Lights A",
  "value": false
}
```

##### Response
```json
{
  "rid": 1,
  "stream": "closed"
}
```

## Remove

Remove a overwritten config/attribute value will restore it to default value defined in profile

#### Request fields

 - path (type:path)
   -  attribute/config path to remove

#### Response columns

No response update.

#### Example usage

##### Request
```json
{
  "rid": 1,
  "method": "remove",
  "path": "/light/@city"
}
```

##### Response

}
```

## Invoke

This method will invoke an action on a node.
params list and

#### Request fields

- permit (string, optional)
  - max permission of this invoke
    - if action require "write" permission to invoke, and requester do have "write" permission, but permit is "read", the action should still return a "permissionDenied" error.
- params (map, optional)
  - The parameters are defined in the action node
  - Can be omitted if the action takes no parameters

#### Response columns

 columns list is defined in the action node or its profile
 but invoke response can also return a column structure to overwrite the value
 the columns structure can only be returned once per action invoke. Columns can also have a "meta" field which is a key:value pair where value is always dynamic.

#### Response updates (rows)
 
 columns results can have one or multiple rows
 if the invoke response' streamstatus is still "open", it can have more updates rows in future response until requester or responder close the stream

#### Example usage

##### Request
```json
{
  "rid": 1,
  "method": "invoke",
  "permit": "read",
  "path": "/echo",
  "params": {
    "string": "dsaisawesome"
  }
}
```

##### Response
```json
{
  "rid": 1,
  "stream": "closed",
  "columns": [
    {"name": "result", "type": "string", "meta": { "test": true, "unit": "F" } }
  ],
  "updates": [
    ["dsaisawesome"]
  ]
}
```

##### Stream Response
```json
{
  "rid": 1,
  "stream": "open",
  "meta":{"mode":"refresh", "meta": {}},
  "columns": [
    {"name": "changes", "type": "string"}
  ],
  "updates": [
    ["first update"]
  ]
}
```

```json
{
  "rid": 1,
  "stream": "closed",
  "updates": [
    ["second update"]
  ]
}
```

##### meta
The default table mode is `stream`. When the mode is omitted the last mode set will be used.
`modify` is not allowed in `stream` mode.

**mode**: optional 
 * `refresh` : Clear all existing rows in requester cache and add the updates. If columns are sent, then all previous columns will be cleared.
 * `append` : Append updates to the end of cache. If columns are sent, they will be added to the existing columns of the table.
 * `stream` : Works similarly as append, but allows requester to safely control the cache size and remove data from beginning. If columns are sent, they will be added to the existing columns of the table.

**modify**: optional
 * `replace 0-10` : remove rows in the range and replace with new updates
 * `insert 0` : insert before the rows number, 0 means insert from beginning

**meta**: optional
 * This is overall table metadata related to the table as a whole. This is solely used for information purposes about the table.

## Subscribe

This method will subscribe to a datapoint node to receive its value and value updatea.

#### Request fields

 - paths (type:list)
   - a list of JSON objects about the subscription
     - path - Path of the node
     - sid - Subscription ID
     - cache (optional, default of 1) - The cache of values the responder contains. If the responder can't write a subscription update to the requester then it will use the cache of values.

#### Response columns

No response update to the direct response.
the value update will be sent in the main subscription stream, which has the following columns

There are multiple elements in the updates field. Each element will contain:

- sid
  - Subscription ID (requester must keep track of which SIDs belong to which node)
- value
  - updated value
- ts (time string in iso8601 format)
  - last update time of the value

#### Response meta
 - status (optional enum)
   - status of the value
     - ok - No issues with the node value (default is status is omitted)
     - stale - The value could potentially be out of date
     - disconnected - Never set by a dslink. The broker sets this if a connection is lost between the dslink and the broker.
 - count (optional int)
   - if the response skip some value, this shows how many updates have happened since last response 
   - only valid value is counted, if value status is not ok, and count is not specified explicitly, the count this updated is treated as 0\
   - skip value will happen when responder connection is slow, or when change happens on requester fater than the updateInterval
 - sum (optional number)
   - the sum value if one or more numeric value is skipped
   - only valid numeric value is added to sum
 - max (optional number)
   - the max value if one or more numeric value is skipped
 - min (optional number)
   - the min value if one or more numeric value is skipped
 - part (optional string)
   - used when sending a very big string or very big List value
   - the value of part will be a fraction number, i.e. "1/2" "2/2"

  ]
}
```

##### Response
