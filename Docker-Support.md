### Create a Server Container

```bash
# Create a container that is exposed on port 8080.
# This command will output a container id to be used by other commands.
# This step only needs to be done once.
$ docker create -p 0.0.0.0:8080:8080 iotdsa/dglux-server
your_container_id

# Start the container.
$ docker start your_container_id

# Stop the container.
$ docker stop your_container_id
```
